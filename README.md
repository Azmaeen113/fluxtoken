# KASCompute - The Future of Decentralized Computing

## Project Overview

KASCompute is a decentralized ecosystem that connects unused GPU and CPU power into a global network built on Kaspa's blockDAG technology, enabling anyone to earn $KCT rewards by providing compute resources.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
cd kascompute-website

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Development

You can edit files directly in your preferred IDE or through GitHub's web interface. The project uses modern React patterns with TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Deployment

This project can be deployed to any static hosting service that supports React applications, such as Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
